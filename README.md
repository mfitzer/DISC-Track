# DISC_TRACK

NFC Based Disc-Golf Companion Application

## Getting Started

The idea behind this project was the create an application where disc golf players could keep track of various statistics (such as score, throw length, disc usage, popularity of course, etc.) through NFC tags that are minimally attached to individual discs and baskets.
